Commit 110 (a nice night's work):

- More dialog in marketplaces
- Crash-proofing of purchasing natives
- Natives are removed from map immediately upon hiring (avoiding re-purchase)
- Natives now fight in combat
- You can now be lazy and have natives fight for you (only order you need to give for a round)
- Calculations of strength (for damage/killing) are now corrected
- Combat system itself is now bug-free for all AI combat (just don't hit cancel on prompts)
- Special movement circumstances have been tweaked to be bug-free (caves and mountains)
- Natives shouldn't follow you after a fight if they're killed in combat

Still need (or at least should aim for):

- Horses (basic implementation - just buy 'em, use 'em, and fight 'em!)
- Buying/Selling (see page 81 of 2nd Ed. rules)
- Display for current gold/fame/notority
- Rewards for killing monsters (should be easy enough)
- Victory points (not mentioned but still somewhat important?)
- Multiplayer playtesting: haven't played a good game in a while, should make sure everything's fine
- Manual specification of treasure values (cheat mode)
- Manual specification of tile chits (cheat mode)
- Introduce other monsters into combat system, ensure stability (make simplifications if needed)

# If we can do this, we're set!
