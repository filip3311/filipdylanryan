Things we still need as a team:

Features:
- Add monsters
- Add sound/site chits
- Investigate resting (not necessary since nothing gets fatigued)
- Attempt to add trading

Documentation:
- We need documentation for the submission! We need someone to wrap this by Tuesday at 6 AM...

Day of the demo:
- Plan for the 15 minutes we have to demo the project!
