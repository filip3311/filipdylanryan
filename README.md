# filipdylanryan

Done today:

- Display for current gold/fame/notority
- Rewards for killing monsters (should be easy enough)
- Patch for repeatedly plundering a clearing and still getting fame and notority
- Players now actually pay for hiring natives (code was previously missing for deducting hiring cost)
- Buying/Selling (see page 81 of 2nd Ed. rules)
- Horses (basic implementation - just buy 'em, use 'em, and fight 'em!)
- Manual specification of treasure values (cheat mode)

Still need (or at least should aim for):

- Victory points (not mentioned but still somewhat important?)
- Multiplayer playtesting: haven't played a good game in a while, should make sure everything's fine
- Manual specification of tile chits (cheat mode)
- Introduce other monsters into combat system, ensure stability (make simplifications if needed)

# If we can do this, we're set!
